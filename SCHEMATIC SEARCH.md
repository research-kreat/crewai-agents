# semantic similarity search

For actual semantic similarity with faster data retrieval, you're venturing into a semantic search or semantic vector search approach, where rather than matching keywords, you compare the actual meaning or context of the content (e.g., title, abstract, domain) to retrieve similar nodes. To achieve this, we'll integrate a semantic vector search method while keeping the retrieval process fast.

Approach:
Preprocess Data: First, create semantic embeddings for your title, abstract, and domain fields (using a model like Sentence-BERT, OpenAI embeddings, or other transformer models) and store them in a vector database like Chroma, FAISS, or Pinecone.

Store Embeddings: Store these embeddings in your database (Neo4j or external). This allows you to quickly fetch semantically similar nodes without checking exact keyword matches.

Retrieve by Semantic Similarity: For any input query, convert it into an embedding and perform a similarity search (vector search) against the pre-stored embeddings to find similar nodes.

Neoj4 + Vector Search: You can combine this with Neo4j by performing a hybrid query that checks for semantic similarity through vector search and simultaneously checks the graph structure.

Steps:
1. Precompute Semantic Embeddings for Knowledge Nodes
Use a Sentence-BERT model or another semantic embedding model to generate embeddings for title, abstract, and domain. If you're using FAISS or Chroma for fast retrieval, you'll store these embeddings separately.

python
Copy
Edit
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def get_embeddings(texts):
    return model.encode(texts)

# Example: Compute embeddings for a batch of Knowledge nodes (titles, abstracts, domains)
titles = ["Title 1", "Title 2", "Title 3"]  # Example titles
abstracts = ["Abstract 1", "Abstract 2", "Abstract 3"]  # Example abstracts
domains = ["Domain 1", "Domain 2", "Domain 3"]  # Example domains

# Create embeddings for each
title_embeddings = get_embeddings(titles)
abstract_embeddings = get_embeddings(abstracts)
domain_embeddings = get_embeddings(domains)

# Combine embeddings or keep them separate as per your requirements
combined_embeddings = np.concatenate([title_embeddings, abstract_embeddings, domain_embeddings], axis=1)
2. Store Embeddings in FAISS or Chroma
Here’s how to store the embeddings in a FAISS index (you can similarly store them in Chroma or any other vector database):

python
Copy
Edit
import faiss

# Convert embeddings to numpy array
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(combined_embeddings.shape[1])  # Using L2 distance for similarity
faiss_index.add(np.array(combined_embeddings, dtype=np.float32))  # Add embeddings to FAISS index
3. Query Embedding Creation and Retrieval
For any user query, you need to compute its embedding and perform a nearest-neighbor search in the vector index to find the most similar knowledge nodes.

python
Copy
Edit
query = "What are the applications of mRNA technology?"  # Example user query

# Get the embedding of the query
query_embedding = get_embeddings([query])

# Search for the most similar knowledge node
k = 5  # Number of similar results
distances, indices = faiss_index.search(np.array(query_embedding, dtype=np.float32), k)
4. Combine with Neo4j Query
Once you have the most similar knowledge nodes by semantic similarity, use Neo4j to retrieve additional graph data, such as relationships and related nodes.

```cypher
WITH $indices AS indices
MATCH (k:Knowledge)
WHERE k.id IN indices
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(assignee:Assignee)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:WRITTEN_BY]->(author:Author)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:HAS_CPC]->(cpc:CPC)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:INVENTED_BY]->(inventor:Inventor)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:HAS_IPC]->(ipc:IPC)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:HAS_KEYWORD]->(keyword:Keyword)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(publisher:Publisher)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:IN_SUBDOMAIN]->(subdomain:Subdomain)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k)-[:USES_TECH]->(technology:Technology)
RETURN 
    k.id AS id,
    k.title AS title,
    COALESCE(k.abstract, "No summary available") AS summary_text,
    k.domain AS domain,
    k.knowledge_type AS knowledge_type,
    k.publication_date AS publication_date,
    k.country AS country,
    k.data_quality_score AS data_quality_score,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT assignee.name) AS assignees,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT author.name) AS authors,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT cpc.name) AS cpcs,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT inventor.name) AS inventors,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT ipc.name) AS ipcs,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT keyword.name) AS keywords,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT publisher.name) AS publishers,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT subdomain.name) AS subdomains,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT technology.name) AS technologies
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC
LIMIT 5
```
Fast Retrieval with Hybrid Search:
Vector Search: This enables the fast retrieval of semantically similar documents based on embedding search, using FAISS, Chroma, or any vector database.

Graph Traversal: Once similar nodes are identified by their embeddings, the Neo4j graph traversal fetches related nodes and relationships.

What You Need:
Vector Database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma) for storing and searching embeddings.

Semantic Embedding Model (e.g., Sentence-BERT) for transforming text data (title, abstract, domain) into semantic vectors.

Neo4j for graph-based relationships and traversals.

Implementation Options:
Standalone: Use vector databases like Chroma or FAISS externally and then combine the top results with Neo4j graph-based retrieval.

Hybrid: Store embeddings directly in Neo4j as properties, allowing fast similarity search using Neo4j’s built-in graph algorithms combined with semantic similarity.

Let me know if you want help setting up FAISS/Chroma for the actual vector search and how to integrate that with Neo4j.
